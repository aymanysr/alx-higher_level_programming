JavaScript is used for many things. Here, i will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

* Scripting (same as i did with Python)
* web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, i will do some scripting. After, i will make my AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
